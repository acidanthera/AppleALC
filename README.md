[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/acidanthera/AppleALC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/acidanthera/AppleALC) [![Scan Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/16166/badge.svg?flat=1)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/16166)

An open source kernel extension enabling native macOS HD audio for not officially supported codecs without any filesystem modifications.

#### Features

- Digital and analog audio support starting from the OS installation
- Recovery HD/macOS Installer audio support
- Automated codec detection
- Unsupported audio controller enabling (internal and external)
- Arbitrary kext patching
- Custom platform/layout injection
- Works with SIP / El Capitan
- Currently compatible with 10.8-10.16

#### Boot arguments

- `-alcdbg` to enable debug printing (available in DEBUG binaries).
- `-alcoff` to disable AppleALC.
- `-alcbeta` to enable AppleALC on unsupported macOS versions.
- `alcid=layout` to set layout-id value.
- `alc-delay=X` and (`alcdelay` property) to delay AppleHDAController startup in milliseconds.
- `-alcdhost` to enable custom audio drivers on 10.12+ (eg. Audirvana)
- `-alcaaplid=X` and (`apple-layout-id` property) to pass overridden layout-id.
- `alctsel=1` to change guarded TCSEL to TC0.
